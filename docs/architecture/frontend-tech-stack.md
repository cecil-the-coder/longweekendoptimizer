This is the definitive technology stack. All development must adhere to these selections.

| Category | Technology | Version | Purpose | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Framework | **React** | 18.x | UI Library | [cite\_start]Meets PRD suggestion[cite: 1, 358]. Ideal for component-based UI. |
| Build Tool | **Vite** | 5.x | Dev Server, Bundler | Extremely fast HMR and build process for a simple app. |
| Language | **TypeScript** | 5.x | Typing | Critical for ensuring the date logic in Story 1.4 is robust. |
| State Management | **React Context** | 18.x | Global State | Simple, built-in. Sufficient for sharing the holiday list. |
| Styling | **Tailwind CSS** | 3.x | CSS Framework | [cite\_start]Aligns with UI/UX spec for a utility-first, clean design[cite: 1, 701]. |
| Testing | **Vitest** | 1.x | Unit Testing | Pairs natively with Vite. [cite\_start]Needed for Story 1.4 logic[cite: 1, 538]. |
