# Template and Framework Selection

[cite\_start]Based on the PRD [cite: 1, 511, 520] [cite\_start]and UI/UX Specification[cite: 1, 676], this project is a greenfield, static-site-only application with no backend. The primary requirements are a simple UI, client-side logic for date calculations, and local storage persistence.

[cite\_start]No specific starter template was provided, but the PRD mentioned React, Svelte, or Vue[cite: 1, 358]. Given the simplicity and the need for a fast, modern build process, I've selected **Vite + React + TypeScript** as the foundation. This provides a minimal, fast-refresh development environment and strong typing for our date logic.
