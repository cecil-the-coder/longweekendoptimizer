## Project Context

**Project Type:** Greenfield
**Selected Track:** BMad Method
**Workflow Path:** method-greenfield.yaml

**Current Workflow Status:**
- **Phase 1 (Planning):**
  - PRD: ✅ Completed (docs/prd/index.md) - Sharded PRD with comprehensive functional and non-functional requirements
  - UX Design: ⚠️ Conditional - Marked as needed based on PRD UI design goals

- **Phase 2 (Solutioning):**
  - Architecture: ✅ Completed (docs/architecture/index.md) - Frontend architecture with React + TypeScript stack
  - Epics & Stories: ✅ Completed - Epic 1 with 5 user stories (1.1-1.5) created within PRD
  - Test Design: ⚠️ Recommended (not completed) - System-level testability review recommended but not required for BMad Method

- **Phase 3 (Gate Check):**
  - Implementation Readiness: 🔄 In Progress (this assessment)

**Artifacts Expected for BMad Method Track:**
- Product Requirements Document (PRD) with functional and non-functional requirements
- System Architecture Document with technical decisions and implementation patterns
- Epic breakdown with user stories, acceptance criteria, and dependencies
- UX Design (if UI components present) - **Expected but not yet completed**
- Test Design (recommended for quality assurance)

**Project Overview:**
The Long Weekend Optimizer is a lightweight, client-side web application designed to help users identify opportunities to create 4-day weekends by strategically taking vacation days adjacent to company holidays that fall on Tuesdays or Thursdays. This is a greenfield MVP project with zero backend requirements, targeting static hosting platforms like Vercel or Netlify.
