# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

* **User Goal:** To quickly and easily identify which paid holidays can be combined with a single vacation day to create an extended 4-day weekend.
* **User Goal:** To have a simple, persistent list of their company's holidays, so they don't have to re-enter them every time they use the tool.
* **Project Goal:** To launch a lightweight, zero-cost, static MVP that validates the core value proposition: saving users time in planning for long weekends.
* **Project Goal:** To achieve a "first-use" success rate of over 90%, where the user successfully gets a valid recommendation.

## Background Context

This project solves a common, minor annoyance for employees: paid holidays on Tuesdays or Thursdays. These "bookend" workdays (a Monday or Friday) feel inefficient and break up potential rest periods.

This PRD outlines an MVP for a simple, client-side utility that solves this problem. It will allow a user to enter their company's holiday schedule, and the application will immediately recommend which adjacent days to take off to "bridge" the holiday to a weekend, creating a 4-day break. All logic will be handled in the browser, and all data will be stored in local storage, requiring no backend or database.
