# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

> "Hi Sally, this PRD for the 'Long Weekend Optimizer' is ready for your review. Please create a UI/UX Specification based on the 'User Interface Design Goals' and the single-epic structure. We need a simple, single-page design that is intuitive and mobile-first."

## Architect Prompt

> "Hi Winston, this PRD is ready for architecture. It's a very simple, static-site-only project with no backend. Please create a lightweight Architecture Document that defines the frontend framework (e.g., Svelte, React/Vite), project structure, and the unit testing strategy for the core date-logic."
