# User Interface Design Goals

* **Overall UX Vision:** A single-purpose tool that is fast, focused, and immediately provides value. It should feel like a simple utility, not a complex "app."
* **Core Screens and Views:**
    * **Screen 1: Holiday Management & Results.** A single-page application.
        * **View 1: Input Area:** A simple form (date picker + text field for name) and "Add Holiday" button.
        * **View 2: Holiday List:** A list of all entered holidays, with a "Delete" button next to each.
        * **View 3: Recommendations:** A clearly distinct area that auto-updates, showing the "long weekend" recommendations based on the list.
* **Accessibility:** WCAG AA
* **Branding:** Minimalist, clean, and modern. A simple logo, a clean font, and a high-contrast, simple color palette.
* **Target Device and Platforms:** Web Responsive (Mobile-first, scales to Desktop).
